    <h1>Welcome to HW 8</h1>
    Below is a PNG of HW8, as well as data I used to make this map <br>
    After researching the safety regulations for Shearon Harris power plant, their website (linked below) said that there is a 10 mile immediate danger zone around the plant, in case of emergency. <br>
    I used the geoprocessing tool "buffer" to display this 10 mile danger zone around the plant. <br>
    Next, I wanted to see how the rivers/fish of NC could potentially be affected by an accident. <br> 
    I used the geoprocessing tool "intersection" to display the intersection of major rivers/lakes and the 10 mile buffer. <br> 
    This showed that 2 major rivers connected to fish spawning areas would overlap with the danger zone, therefore, there is a huge possibility that given an accident, fish populations could suffer immensely. <br>
