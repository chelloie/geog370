    <h1>Welcome to HW 7</h1>
    Below is a PNG of HW7, as well as my CSV file that I created based upon data I found from the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Serviecs. <br>
    I entered all the data, because I could only find it in PDF format, and I cleaned it to be compatible with QGIS. <br>
    For this map, I chose to compare the dogs taken in at all county animal shelters, with the dogs euthanized. <br>
    I love animals and I think that "No-Kill" Shelters are important and should be funded by the government. <br>
